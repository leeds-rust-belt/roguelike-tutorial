A Brief history of what I did to make stuff work.

This is WSL2 on top of windows10 running ubuntu 22-04
Following the tutorial at: https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/

Started new project in the standard way
Installed libtcod which required libsdl2-dev - this actually had some issues installing via apt ... probably wsl related. I had to manually install libegl as the dependencies were b0rked

First problem ... there is no display attached to wsl so running the initial window does nothing. Running an xserver just causes a segfault.
    OK - above was weirdness with the xserver. Updated wsl and it is runnig now. Suspect xlaunch might need to go at some point

Using latest rand crate rather than the one listed in the tutorial.
    Inefficient use of rnadom() call in loop - could move to cached rng Installed
    Example in tutorial is using old rand crate and the range generation signature has now changed to a range rather than start and end values.
